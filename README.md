Some simple exercises completed in Ruby

**my_enumerable**
Recreated some of the functionality of the Enumberable module in my own version.

**caesar_cipher**

**stock_picker**
Determines most profitable buy/sell option for a given stock where the price each day is given as an array of numbers. 

**substrings**
Counts the instances of strings in a dictionary that occur in a given string.  Returns the result in a hash of strings => occurences.

**bubble_sort**
